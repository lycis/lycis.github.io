When you are in the great situation to be present and involved when a new team
emerges from the structures of an organisation you should seize the opportunity
and get a great time going. Throughout my coaching experience I seldom had the
chance to participate in the start-up process of a team, but I quickly learned
that the first few days and weeks are the most important ones.

A great deal of the team performance depends on the internal chemistry of the
individuals. Selecting the right people for the right task is the first 
challenge you need to handle - and I've seen many organisations doing it badly.
You can not expect a so-called team to perform by just throwing a group of
people into a room that seem to have the right skillset for a problem to solve.
I have seen individuals delivering great results on their area, but when put 
into a team they start to just suck because the mix of people did not work out.

Usually, when a team assembles for the first time people start to figure out 
who the others are, what they will be working on and how the team will behave
as a whole (_Bruce Tuckman_ calls this the _Forming_ stage). Also first 
policies and assumptions will be declared that define how members of the team
will interact with each other. When acting as a coach it usually will be your
goal to help the team and each individual member to get a grasp of the situation
and help them navigate. Also you want to lay out good foundations for
the team as a whole so they will not get wrecked in the upcoming _Storming_.
