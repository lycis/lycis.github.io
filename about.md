Since 2014 I'm back at Automic working as Agile Coach as well as Software Engineer.
Currently I'm with an internal services &amp; enablement team that is - well - enabling other teams to craft more and more features on our core product.

In the years of 2012 until my break from  UC4/Automic I was working as the first Scrum Master in the company, evangelising and spreading the idea of Agile development and methods. My primary team was the software maintenance team of the core product.
